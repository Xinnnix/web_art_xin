            Laura Brothers’ out_4_pizza is a LiveJournal blog to which the artist posts digital paintings and animated gifs. Each post, which may contain one or several images, is labeled only with a brief, cryptic title and displayed against a black background.

            <a href="http://out4pizza.com/">out_4_pizza</a> is a rigorous exploration of the particular affordances of “painting” with the computer for an online audience. Many of her works use pixel-perfect compositions that create moiré effects when resized or scrolled, coming into a kind of focus only when viewed at 100% scale. Brothers takes particular interest in the possibilities of vertical scrolling, which enables modes of viewership and narrative that have few precedents in art history.
